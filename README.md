# One_Way_ANOVA
In the folder 'one_way_ANOVA', you can find four files and one folder. Here are their brief introduction.
# task introduction.pdf
In this file, it is shown that five tasks should be solved.
# data.xlsx
It stores all the data in the file. As described in the task introduction, the dataset describes the online group collected from QQ, and we select 2040 online groups with corresponding information in 14 columns.
# ANOVA_F_Table.pdf
This file shows critical value F with its probability p, which is a reference in the process of one_way_ANOVA.
# My_report.pdf
This file shows my results on these tasks.
# code 
Here are 13 .py files in this folder,which perfectly solved the problems in the task introduction.\
1. The 'test_normality.py' solves the task 3(a).  \
2. The 'test _five_components.py' solves the task 3(b).\
3. The 'ANOVA.py' solves the task 3(c).\
4. The 'test_another_three_columes.py' solves the task 4.\
5. The 'non_norma_ANOVA_C3-C2.py'/'non_norma_ANOVA_C4-C2.py'/'non_norma_ANOVA_C8-C2.py'/'non_norma_ANOVA_C3-C4-C8.py'/'non_norma_ANOVA_C3-C4.py'/'non_norma_ANOVA_C3-C8.py'/'non_norma_ANOVA_C4-C8.py' solves the task 5.


**Attention!**

In the file 'ANOVA_invoking.py' ,I give a solution to the problem 3(b) by invoking the 'scipy.stats.f_oneway' package .\
And in the file 'non_normal_ANOVA_invoking.py' ,I give a solution to the problem 5(b) by invoking the 'scipy.stats.f_oneway' package .
